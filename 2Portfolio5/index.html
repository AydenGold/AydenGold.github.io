            <h2>Sample 1: Mid term reflection</h2>
            <p>
                As I reflect on the first half of this semester, I realize that my college experience has mostly
consisted of academic challenges, thinking about the future, and the development of essential life
skills. College has pushed me to be more independent and think more about how I manage my
time, study habits, and personal well-being. Time management and study habits were vital to my
success so far, and I see opportunities for further improvement in the remainder of the semester.
In this reflection, I will explore how I have managed my time, study habits, note-taking, and
self-care, and my plan for the rest of the semester.
Time management is one of the most important skills in college, and so far, I believe I have
managed my time effectively. I rely on a digital calendar to organize my day-to-day schedule,
which includes class time and class locations. Having a clear visual representation of my classes
allowed me to get more familiar with my schedule. After every class I check blackboard and
other sites that may have assignments which helps me stay on top of my coursework.
By blocking out specific time slots for study sessions and assignments, I avoid last-minute
cramming and the stress of looming deadlines. For instance, in my computing class, I’ve had
assignments that are due in a week, so when I have a day in which I have a lot of free time I can
knock it out easily. The entire habit of reviewing my calendar multiple times a day gives me a
sense of control over my schedule and helps me maintain focus throughout the day.
Despite my generally successful approach to time management, I have noticed one area for
improvement: procrastination. While I don’t frequently submit assignments late, I sometimes
find myself delaying starting projects. This tendency can lead to unnecessary stress as deadlines
approach. For example, I have found myself rushing to complete a programming task when I
could have begun it earlier. To address this, I plan to pick out the assignments with upcoming

due dates and spend a period of time dedicated to completing them. By doing this, I can reduce
stress, and improve the quality of my assignments.
Another challenge I face is balancing academic commitments with personal interests. While I
prioritize my studies, I’ve found that taking time to relax is essential for recharging between
assignments. My digital calendar has been invaluable in helping me manage both schoolwork
and relaxation, allowing me to carve out moments to rest and refresh. However, there have been
instances when personal activities take up more time than planned, cutting into my academic
schedule. Going forward, I plan to set clear boundaries for my personal time, ensuring that I stick
to my study plan while still benefiting from the recharging effects of relaxation.
When it comes to study habits, I have developed a system that helps me retain information and
prepare for exams. Before any quiz or test, I test myself on the material I’ve learned to assess
how well I understand it. This self-testing method gives me a clear sense of which areas I am
confident in and which areas need more attention. For example, before my Precalculus quizzes, I
review formulas and practice solving problems to reinforce my understanding. This method has
proven to be an effective way to study, as it forces me to engage with the material more deeply
than simply reading through my notes. Additionally, if I find that I am not confident in certain
topics, I revisit my lecture notes and textbooks to review the information. This two-step
approach—testing myself first, then revisiting material as needed—ensures that I don’t spend
unnecessary time on concepts I already understand and can focus on areas where I need more
practice.
I’ve found that I do really well with minimal note-taking, focusing only on the most important
points during lectures. This way, I can stay engaged and really absorb the material. Sometimes I

use the notes from Blackboard since they contain most of the concepts. This keeps me organized
and prevents me from feeling overwhelmed by too much information. Overall, I feel this
approach helps me understand and remember the material better, making my study sessions more
effective.
Looking forward, I also plan to put more effort into studying. A technique that might help
improve my studying involves reviewing material at increasing intervals over time, which has
been shown to improve long-term retention of information. I believe this approach will be
particularly beneficial for subjects like Precalculus, where concepts build on one another, and
retaining information is important.
While I have generally been successful in managing my academic responsibilities, I have faced a
few challenges that have required adjustment. One challenge I have encountered is maintaining
focus and consistency throughout the semester. At times, I find myself getting distracted or
losing motivation, especially when the workload feels overwhelming. For example, there have
been days when I struggled to stay focused during study sessions, which led to less productive
use of my time.
Self-care has been a crucial part of my college experience so far, as it has allowed me to maintain
my mental and physical health while keeping up with my academic workload. I make an effort to
finish my assignments early enough so that I can have time for myself at the end of the day. This
personal time is important for recharging and preventing burnout, especially during busy weeks.
Activities like watching movies, listening to music, and spending time with friends help me
unwind and maintain a healthy balance between school and personal life.

Maintaining this balance has positively impacted my academic performance, as it allows me to
stay focused and productive when it’s time to study. However, I realize that I could do more to
prioritize my physical health. While I am generally good at managing stress through relaxation, I
haven’t done very much physical exercise. I've seen on the internet that regular physical activity
can improve focus, memory, and overall cognitive function, which in turn enhances academic
performance. Going forward, I plan to incorporate exercise into my daily routine, even if it’s just
some pushups. This addition will not only boost my physical health but also improve my mental
clarity and energy levels, making me more productive in both my academic and personal life.
As I look ahead to the rest of the semester, I plan to build on the strategies that have worked for
me so far while also adopting new approaches to improve my academic performance and
personal wellbeing. An important habit I need to reduce is procrastination. This approach will
allow me to work more consistently and avoid the stress of last-minute deadlines. In addition, I
will refine my study habits to retain information more effectively and ensure that I am better
prepared for exams. I will also experiment with different note-taking strategies.
Lastly, I will continue to prioritize self-care by maintaining a balance between academic work
and personal time. This includes setting aside time for relaxation and hobbies, as well as
incorporating regular exercise into my routine to boost both my physical and mental health. If I
was able to completely follow my plan, I believe I would be able to achieve greater efficiency
and success in both my academic and personal life.
Reflecting on the first half of this semester, I can see that I have grown both academically and
personally. My time management, study habits, and self-care practices have allowed me to
navigate the demands of college life while maintaining a sense of balance. However, I recognize

that there are areas for improvement, particularly in reducing procrastination and refining my
study techniques. As I move forward, I am confident that by implementing these new strategies
and continuing to prioritize balance, I will be able to maintain academic success and personal
wellbeing throughout the rest of the semester.

            <h2>Sample 2: Academic Journal</h2>
            <p>
            In the next semester, I would choose the courses like Software Engineering, Advanced Programming Techniques and Introduction to Computer Networks because these courses would help me a lot with my Computer Science major and in my future career.
The first course I would choose is Software Engineering. This is important because it will help me learn how to manage projects and work in a team to create software. In most software jobs, you have to work with a team to make software, so an important part of the job is knowing how to plan your project and organize your team. You also have to learn how to fix and maintain software when there are problems, and this software design and maintenance is a major part of being a developer.
The second course is Advanced Programming Techniques. I would choose this course because it will help me to become more advanced at coding. It will teach me different techniques and algorithms to solve more complex problems in software. I would learn how to write more sophisticated code to make my programs run faster and use less memory. This is important for any job where I need to write code that will work efficiently.
The third course I would choose is Introduction to Computer Networks. This course will help me to become more knowledgeable in how computers send information, and how data moves and is stored in large networks. I would learn about network protocols, how data moves along networks, and how I can keep information secure. I know that all these classes are related to my major but I believe these three classes would benefit me in the future because all of these skills are essential for jobs in network administration or cybersecurity jobs, where I need to keep data secure. I think all of these courses would also help me to prepare for different careers in the field of computer science. I would be more qualified for jobs like writing software, managing systems, or even cyber security. These skills would give me important knowledge, and help me choose a career path in whatever area of computer science I decide to pursue.

If I had to rate my college experience so far, I would give it an eight out of ten. I chose this rating
because my classes have been pretty easy, and I’ve been having a good time overall. However,
the downside is that some of my classes are far from my dorm and sometimes my classes start 
as early as 8:30, which makes for a long walk, and I’ve had to do a lot of homework for different 
classes . I was surprised to find that the workload hasn’t been much more than what I 
experienced in high school. My daily routine has been pretty much what I expected, such as 
eating at Chick-fil-A often and hanging out in my dorm room. I haven’t met a lot of new people 
yet which isn't much different from normal, though I do know a few people from my high school 
and have three roommates to get to know. One reason I haven't made many new connections is
that I’m not particularly good at approaching or talking to new people. Also after looking at 
garnet gate there was one organization that looked interesting. The one that interests me is the 
Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), which meets at 7:00 p.m. I’m considering joining 
because my major is related to computing, and I’m eager to learn more about both the technical 
aspects and machinery involved in the field. Joining a group like ACM might help me meet more
people while enhancing my knowledge and skills in my chosen major.
